"""Risk is redesigned as three independent assessments of the frozen Trader
plan, followed by exactly one cross-review round -- not a competitive,
repeated debate (see fork README: "Risk as independent assessment + one
cross-review"). This covers the independence/cross-review properties
themselves; structured-state mechanics are in test_risk_stance_structured.py
and the deterministic integrity check is in test_risk_integrity.py."""
