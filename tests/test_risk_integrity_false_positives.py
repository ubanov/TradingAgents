"""Risk/Manager integrity false-positive fixes from the first real NVDA Risk
architecture validation run (Risk Integrity: WARN with 11 findings, several
spurious). Three independent issues, all in the shared
``tradingagents.agents.integrity_shared`` module:

A. WITHDRAWN_VALUE_REUSED's tolerance was loose enough (0.1% relative) to
   treat a canonical replacement a cent away from a retired value (240.65
   retired -> 240.64 canonical) as the same retired value.
B. UNIT_ERROR fired on any LEVEL_WORDS sentence sharing space with any
   percentage, even a legitimate distance/share-of-profit/ratio percentage.
C. NEW_UNSUPPORTED_THRESHOLD fired on a comparison-style trigger word
   ("above", "below", "exceeds", ...) even in purely descriptive/
   comparison/arithmetic prose with no conditional "new rule" semantics.
