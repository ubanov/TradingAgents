"""Deterministic, LLM-free integrity check for the Risk phase's output.

Risk reviewers evaluate the frozen Trader plan; they must not become a
second, unverified research/trading-system design phase (observed in real
runs -- Risk introducing new thresholds, sizing rules, historical analogies,
and portfolio-percentage rules, then spending later turns correcting claims
it invented itself). This runs once, after the single cross-review round and
before Portfolio Manager, over every Risk reviewer's rendered text. No LLM
call is made here (see fork README: "Risk integrity check").

Shares its numeric-extraction/sentence-scanning primitives with the Research
Manager integrity check (``tradingagents.agents.integrity_shared``) so the
two checkers cannot drift apart on the same underlying logic; the frozen
evidence pool reuses ``managers.integrity_check.build_known_number_pool``
for the same reason.

Conservative by design: false positives (a real, sourced number wrongly
flagged) are worse than false negatives. See ``RiskFindingCategory`` for the
full, fixed set of checks.
