"""Deterministic, LLM-free integrity check for the Research Manager's output.

The Research Verifier already checks the Bull/Bear research before the
Research Manager sees it, but the manager is itself a free-text-capable LLM
call: nothing stopped it from reintroducing a numeric threshold, sizing rule,
or price level that was never in the verified evidence (observed in real
runs -- a manager inventing a MACD-histogram threshold, a volume threshold, an
allocation percentage, or a yield trigger that no analyst report, verified
thesis, or deterministic calculation ever produced; also a manager
reintroducing a narrative claim Bull/Bear had already corrected during
review, a reward/risk ratio inconsistent with the deterministic trade
metrics, and a simple relational error such as stating one known price is
below another when it is not). This module closes that gap with one cheap,
deterministic pass over the manager's rendered output, run after the
Research Manager and before the Trader. No LLM call is made here, by design
(see fork README: "Research Manager integrity check").

The numeric-extraction/sentence-scanning primitives are shared with the Risk
integrity check (see ``tradingagents.agents.integrity_shared``) so the two do
not drift apart on the same underlying logic.

The check is intentionally narrow and conservative: false positives (a real,
sourced number wrongly flagged) are worse than false negatives (a low-value
new number that slips through). See ``ManagerFindingCategory`` for the full,
fixed set of checks.
