"""Deterministic text-scanning utilities shared by the Research Manager and
Risk Management integrity checks.

Both checks are LLM-free, conservative, sentence-level scans over a model's
free-text output: a number near operational-trigger language ("exceeds",
"reduce ... by") is a candidate decision rule, checked against a known-good
pool of numbers already traceable to evidence; a two-number comparison
("X is below Y") is checked for arithmetic consistency on its own; a claimed
reward/risk ratio is checked against the deterministic ``TradeMetrics``
already computed in code. Kept in one module so a change to the underlying
number-extraction or sentence-splitting logic cannot drift between the two
checkers (see fork README: "Research Manager integrity check" and "Risk
integrity check").

False positives (a real, sourced number wrongly flagged) are worse than false
negatives (a low-value new number that slips through) -- every function here
is deliberately narrow sentence-level pattern matching, not a general NLP
parser.
